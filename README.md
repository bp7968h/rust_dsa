# Data Structure and Algorithms in Rust
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository, where I've implemented various data structures and algorithms in the Rust programming language. This repository is a part of my journey to become a better developer, and I hope it can be helpful for others as well.

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Rust. Each algorithm is implemented in a straightforward manner, with a focus on readability and understanding the core concepts.

## Implementation
Below are the data structure and algorithms which are currently implemented and this will continue on daily basis(that my plan).
### `Sorting Algorithms`:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

### `Searching Algorithms`:
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### `Data Structure`:
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Stack Contiguous Memory**
- **Stack Non-Contiguous Memory**

## `To be Continued`
